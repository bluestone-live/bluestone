# Arcanist support libraries

This is where we can add new classes to control how Arcanist behaves. See [Adding New Classes](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabcontrib/article/adding_new_classes/) for more details.

Once we add a new class, modify a class name or change folder structures, we need to do `arc liberate` right in this directory. It will update the library metadata.
